===========
<img src="https://raw.github.com/xeoron/idownloaded/master/images/idownloaded_screenshot.png"/>

OS X keeps a record of every filename downloaded and source location (webpages not included). This list is kept outside of your web browser of choice. Deleting your browsing or download history does not purge the system database of this information. 

Why Use iDownloaded
===================
	1.	Find where you got a file online that you deleted by mistake.
	2.	Take control of your privacy, so you can view and delete this list of filenames as needed.
