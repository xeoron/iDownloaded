iDownloaded: is no longer supported as of macOS 14 or higher
===========
<img src="https://raw.github.com/xeoron/idownloaded/master/images/idownloaded_screenshot.png"/>

OS X keeps a record of every filename downloaded and source location (webpages not included) for Safari, Google Chrome, and perhaps other programs that use Webkit/Blink. This list is kept outside of your web browser of choice. Deleting your browsing or download history does not purge the system database of this information. 

Why Use iDownloaded
===================
	1.	Find where you got a file online that you deleted by mistake.
	2.	Take control of your privacy, so you can view and delete this list of filenames as needed.
	
Requirements:
=====
iDownloaded (GUI version)

    Mac OSX.6 Snow Leopard or higher
