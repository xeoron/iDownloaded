iDownloaded.sh (cmdline version):
=====
OS X keeps a record of every filename downloaded and source location (webpages not included). This list is kept outside of your web browser of choice. Deleting your browsing or download history does not purge the system database of this information. 

If you are worried about your privacy, then use this script manually or add it to a cron job so it will be purged regularly.
